mysqlnd statistics analytics is work in progress. Goal is to help users to
extract important information from the mysqlnd statistics.

Even though this is currently part of the Symfony bundle this should become
a stand-alone library to be used in other environments.

If you know good metrics please add them to the analytics.xml and send a pull
request! (Same for any other improvement!)
